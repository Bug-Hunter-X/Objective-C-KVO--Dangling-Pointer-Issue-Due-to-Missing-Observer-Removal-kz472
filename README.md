This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and memory management.  Failure to properly remove observers before the observed object is deallocated leads to dangling pointers and potential crashes. The `bug.m` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.m` provides the corrected implementation with proper observer removal.
